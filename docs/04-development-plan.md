# Development Plan

## Yoga Center Attendance System

This document defines **implementation sequence and phase status only**.

## 1. Scope of This Document

This document answers: *what gets built next, in what order, and what must
exist first.*

It does **not** define:

| Concern | Authoritative source |
|---|---|
| Product requirements, business rules, V1 scope | `01-product.md` |
| Information architecture, UX flows, screen requirements | `02-ux.md` |
| Colors, typography, spacing, radius, shadows | `03-visual-tokens.md` |
| Structural/layout reference per screen | `wireframe/Yoga Attendance.pdf` |
| Visual appearance reference | `ui-reference/` |
| Coding, architecture and validation rules | `CLAUDE.md` |

If this document ever appears to contradict one of the above, the source above
wins and this document is the one that must be corrected.

Requirements are never introduced here. If a phase below implies functionality
that is not in `01-product.md`, that is a defect in this document.

## 4. Dependency Map

Derived from the core product model in `01-product.md` and the UX relationships
in `02-ux.md`. **This drives the sequence — not convenience.**

```text
Instructors ──────────────┐
                          ↓
Batches ──────────────► Schedule ──► Class Sessions ──┐
                                                      │
Students ──┬──► Batch Enrollment ─────────────────────┤
           │                                          ↓
           └──► Membership ──────────────────────► Attendance
                                                      │
                                    ┌─────────────────┴───────────┐
                                    ↓                             ↓
                            Attendance History                 Reports
```

Stated explicitly:

- **Schedule** depends on **Batches** + **Instructors**
  (`01-product.md` §7: a schedule carries its own instructor; instructors are
  assigned at schedule level).
- **Attendance** depends on **Students** + **Memberships** + **Batch
  Enrollments** + **Batches** + **Schedule / Class Sessions**, because
  eligibility requires an active enrollment *and* an active membership on the
  session date.
- **Attendance History** depends on **Attendance**.
- **Reports** depend on **Attendance**, plus Students/Batches for filters.
- **Dashboard** depends on **Students**, **Batches**, **Schedule / Class
  Sessions** and **Attendance**, because it summarises all of them.

### Two sequencing consequences

**1. Instructors must precede Schedule.**
Instructors live under Settings in the IA, but Schedule cannot be completed
without instructor records to assign. Settings is therefore split: the
**Instructors** area is built before Schedule (phase 9); the remaining Settings
areas (Center Profile, Roles & Permissions) come later (phase 18). This is an
implementation ordering decision only — it does not change the approved IA,
where Instructors remains under Settings.

**2. Dashboard is sequenced late, not early.**
The Dashboard is an aggregation surface. Building it before its underlying
feature areas exist would mean building it against placeholder data and then
rebuilding it. It is therefore implemented once its data sources exist
(phase 16). The Dashboard *route* already exists as a shell placeholder; only
its real content is deferred.

---

## 5. Phase Definitions

### Phase 5 — Documentation / source-of-truth cleanup
Establish consistent, non-contradictory documentation before feature work.
No application code changes.

### Phase 6 — App Shell structural validation

**Structural decision — RESOLVED.**

Approved shell structure:

```text
AppShell
├── Sidebar
└── MainColumn
    ├── Header
    └── MainContent
```

- The Sidebar is the full-height left column and begins at the top of the
  viewport, remaining vertically continuous.
- The Header is scoped to the main content column and does **not** span across
  the Sidebar.
- Main content begins below the Header.
- Desktop: Sidebar 256px wide, Header 48px high, main content starting at
  x=256 / y=48.
- Mobile: the desktop Sidebar is hidden and the existing drawer navigation
  behaviour is used.

Validation basis: independently confirmed against the approved visual
references, then verified in a real browser using computed layout measurements
across desktop and mobile viewports, with lint and build passing.

The shell is now a stable foundation for feature screens, and phase 7 may
proceed.

### Phase 7 — Reusable layout primitives *(next)*
`Container`, `Section`, `PageHeader`.

Built **after** the shell structure is settled and **before** the first feature
screen, so that every feature screen composes the same primitives rather than
re-inventing page scaffolding. Building them earlier risks designing them
against a shell that then changes; building them later guarantees rework across
already-built screens.

These are presentation primitives only — no feature logic.

### Phase 8 — Login
Admin and Instructor authentication, role-based access.

⚠️ `ui-reference/login.png` shows Remember me, Google Sign-In and a theme
toggle. **None are approved V1 functionality.** See `CLAUDE.md` →
"Known reference conflict: `login.png`".

### Phases 9–18 — Feature areas
Implemented in dependency order:

Instructors → Students → Memberships → Batches → Schedule → Attendance →
Attendance History → Dashboard → Reports → remaining Settings

Each feature area follows the progression defined in `CLAUDE.md`:

```text
Feature UI → business logic → validation → data access → Supabase integration
```

### Phase 19 — Integration & business-rule validation
End-to-end verification of the historical-integrity rules in `01-product.md`
§12 — particularly that membership expiry/renewal, batch changes, student or
batch deactivation, and schedule changes never alter past attendance.

### Phase 20 — Responsive and UX/UI audit
Desktop / tablet / mobile review against the approved wireframes and visual
references, plus an accessibility pass.

### Phase 21 — Production / case-study readiness
Final polish. A case-study document may be created at this point if the
portfolio goal requires it.

## 6. Supabase / Backend Integration

Supabase integration is **progressive and feature-oriented**, not a separate
backend-first phase.

Per `CLAUDE.md`:

- Do not build the entire backend before implementing features.
- Do not create the complete database schema prematurely.
- Each feature area carries its own schema, data access and integration work
  through to completion before the next feature begins.

The schema therefore grows feature by feature, in the dependency order in §4.

---

## 7. Open Items Requiring Decision

| Item | Status |
|---|---|
| **Brand logo asset** | No approved logo/lotus asset exists in the repository. Branding is currently text-only. Requires a supplied asset or an explicit decision to remain text-only. |

The AppShell structural relationship between Sidebar and Header previously
listed here is **resolved** — see Phase 6 in §5.

---

## 8. Validation Checkpoints

Every phase must satisfy the validation requirements in `CLAUDE.md` before it
is considered complete:

- `npm run lint` passes
- `npm run build` passes
- Behaviour verified in a real browser, not only via build success
- Approved UX preserved (`02-ux.md`)
- Approved visual tokens used (`03-visual-tokens.md`)
- Responsive behaviour across desktop / tablet / mobile
- Accessibility: semantics, keyboard navigation, visible focus, contrast
- No invented requirements
- Business rules from `01-product.md` upheld

Feature phases additionally require the relevant business rules to be verified,
not assumed.

---

## 9. Git Checkpoints

One focused commit per completed phase, following the `CLAUDE.md` Git
Discipline rules.

- Documentation changes are not mixed into feature commits.
- Each phase is reviewed before it is committed.
- Commit messages follow the established convention
  (`chore:`, `docs:`, `feat:`, `fix:`).

---

## 10. Maintenance

Update this document when a phase completes or when sequencing changes.

Do not update it to record product, UX or visual decisions — those belong in
`01-product.md`, `02-ux.md` and `03-visual-tokens.md` respectively.
